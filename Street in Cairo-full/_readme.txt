Given the information in each page in “Street in Cairo,” I decided that the most relevant pieces of information to include in my metadata included: page number, page description, color scheme, drawing description, notes on physical damages, keywords, and a summary of the content. I included the page number to make it easy to navigate the CSV and to make sure all following information aligned with the correct page. I included a description of the page to make each page easily distinguishable from one another, as the pages often followed the same format (text with red ink graphic or full page artwork). I noted the color scheme because the way the book was printed, using chromolithography, required there to be limited colors in every image. I wanted the color schemes to indicate this limitation and also help differentiate the pages from one another. By including a description of the drawings on the page, I was able to place emphasis on the red ink sketches included on the pages with text while having a space to also write a more in-depth description on the pieces of art present throughout the artifact. I noted any physical damages on the page to make obvious the age and wear of the book while also emphasizing the details that a viewer may miss while viewing the digital version as opposed to the physical copy. I included keywords to serve as a shortcut of relevant topics on the page, which I then supplemented with a summary of the content and text on each page.
