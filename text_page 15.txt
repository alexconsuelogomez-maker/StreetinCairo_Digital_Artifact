Here is also a colossal statue of Thi and a sarcophagus of the Sacred
Bull of the later Polemic period. This Temple is a perfect storehouse of
Ancient Egyptiana.

Just north of the Temple the Sudanese contingent has pitched its
swans, and there will the strange people from the Soudan and from Nubia repeat their daily life as at home. The Soudanese have traveled to some extent but these Nubians are the first to leave the borders of Egypt. Their peculiarities will prove interesting.

This little book is written simply as a suggestion. To describe the
beauties, the quaintness or the picturesqueness of the Cairo Street would be impossible in a volume so small. Only a journey there will satisfy an interest once excited. Visit it when basking in the heat of the midday sun, or bathed in the glowing colors of departing day, it is alike beautiful. Go when the cold grey moonlight illumines it, when the mysterious gloom of night hangs upon it and its grandeur will appeal to every fiber of your being. It is a marvellous creation, artistic in conception, truthful in the interpretation of its beautiful models, a revelation in the perfection of its accomplishment. When the Columbian Exposition shall have become a thing of the past and its memories hazy with the flight of time, if there shall be one spot which shall remain brighter than all the rest, that one will be its beautiful Cairo Street, in the Midway Plaisance.
