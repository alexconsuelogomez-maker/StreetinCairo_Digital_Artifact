there is the ceremony of the "Moulid" or birthday festival, where joy and pleasure are indulged in to the fullest extent. The street is filled for a time with tents of elaborate descrip-tion, and conjurers, astrologers, necromancers, snake charmers and dancers perform their most marvelous feats.Every variety of life is here represented, and you will find it sufficiently versatile to create an unimpaired interest. It is an object lesson of oriental life of great educational importance. For a moment leave the Arabian or modern Egyptian to his pleasures and step into the realm of ancient Egypt, as portrayed in the ancient Temple of Luxor, now completely restored. This is an exact reproduction, of a temple built by Amenoph III, 1550 B. C., and is the only one ever restored. On the outer walls are sculptured battle scenes as well as those representing the worshipping of the divinities. The two obelisks are exact reproductions of the original obelisks.They are seventy-five feet high and five feet square at the base. The obelisk to the right of the entrance has sculptured on it in hieroglyphics a dedication to the World's Columbian Exposition.

Entering this temple the visitor's attention will be attracted by obelisks, statues and sphinxes, a gateway flanked by pyramidal towers and hierogly. phic inscriptions copied from the ancient monuments. Amenoph Ill, eighteenth dynasty, 1550 B. C.; Rameses II, nineteenth dynasty, 1400 B. C. and Nectanebo II, thirtieth dynasty, 345 B. C., are the heroes of the historical scenes. Amon-Ra, Maut and Khons are in the shrine as the trinity of Thebes. The judgment of the deacon with the fate of the justified and the condemned, the death and resurrection of the Son of God are illustrated.
